# DriverPass System Design

### The Problem
New driver's have a limited amount of material to study for their exams and even fewer option to practice for the on road skills test. DriverPass plans to fill this gap in the market by providing online courses and the ability to easily book in person driving lessons online. 

### The Solution
DriverPass will require a web based application to reach the maximum amount of users on a variety of different devices between desktop and mobile. Given the limited size of the company, a managed cloud based back-end will be implemented to handle security and maintainence. 

### System Design Approach

##### Gathering Requirements
The first step was to gather requirements based on the user's needs. It is always important to consider the end user as a designer because discrepencies may exist between what a designer envisions as ideal versus an actual end user. Listening to the user eliminates any personal biases and ensures a more seamless implementation. 

##### Creating Design Documents
With the user's requirements in mind, a GANTT chart was created to establish a timeline and work began on the sysyem design documents and associated UML digrams

>> Figure 1. - Use Case Diagram

As depicted in the use case diagram, DriverPass requries basic functionality for users and administrators including creating reading updating and deleting data as necessary. Several addition design documents were drafted including activity diagrams to further elaborate on our given use cases and class diagrams to depict how our program logic should be delegated among system objects. 

### Takeaways
System analysis and design is crucial in developing a useful and efficient system of any kind. A well designed system is the foundation upon which a successful software application sits. I feel that a particulatly good job was done in creating the system design document and UML diagrams. If I could go back and revise one document, it would be the business requirements document. While I feel that it was adequate for our intended use case, I also feel that asking more questions and getting more detail on the stakeholder requirements would have been worthwhile.
