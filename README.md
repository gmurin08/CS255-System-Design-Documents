# CS-255 DriverPass System Analysis And Design

### The Problem
New driver's have a limited amount of material to study for their exams and even fewer option to practice for the on road skills test. DriverPass plans to fill this gap in the market by providing online courses and the ability to easily book in person driving lessons online. 

### The Solution
DriverPass will require a web based application to reach the maximum amount of users on a variety of different devices between desktop and mobile. Given the limited size of the company, a managed cloud based back-end will be implemented to handle security and maintainence. 

### System Design Approach

Listening to the user eliminates any personal biases and ensures a more seamless implementation.
